Half-edge data structure was chosen as the primary focus for procedurally generated meshes because of its resilience and lightweight requirements when correct. A half-edge points at a vertex (many half-edges-to-one-vertex) relationship, the face who owns the halfedge (one face-to-many HE relationship), the halfedge may or may not point to a single adjacent half-edge on a different face (one HE to one symmetric half-edge), and is basically all pointers. Although it was suppose to make Catmull-Clark subdivision easier...Dan and Claudy both had minor brain scarring after their attempts.

Our geometry is separate from our procedurally generated meshes. In other words, we don’t have mesh “integration”. We kept procedurally generated meshes in a separate class to prevent catmull clark from being fired upon the mesh.

The raytrace button and catmull clark button don’t do anything currently, probably because there isn’t any code in the Room Editor 5000 to connect the buttons to.

We finished part of the ray generation milestone. We were not able to get aspect ratio to affect the picture without blanking it.

Ray intersection tests are complete. A winner is us. If there are any bugs lurking in the intersection testing, its in the cube-ray intersection test function. It remains separate from the Room Editor 5000 code project.
